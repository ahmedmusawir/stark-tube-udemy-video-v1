# These instructions guide the OpenAI TTS model's delivery
TTS_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Voice: Confident, dynamic, and charismatic, with a clear and compelling cadence that makes complex topics feel exciting and easy to understand. The voice should have a natural energy that builds anticipation.

Tone: Enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and forward-looking. It's the voice of someone who is passionate about the subject and genuinely wants the audience to share in the excitement of discovery. Avoids being dry or monotonous at all costs.

Dialect: Crisp, modern, and professional. The delivery is conversational, like a trusted expert talking directly to an intelligent friend.

Pronunciation: Flawlessly clear and precise. Key technical terms and brand names are articulated with authority. The pacing is deliberate, using short pauses to emphasize critical points and give the listener a moment to absorb the information.

Features: Uses a mix of upbeat, declarative statements and engaging, hypothetical questions ("What if you could...?"). The voice should naturally crescendo when revealing key insights and maintain a steady, engaging rhythm during explanations. This is the voice of a top-tier creator at the peak of their game.
