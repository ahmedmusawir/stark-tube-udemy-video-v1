Alright, let’s start at the command line—because this is where all the real work gets done.

First up, we’re running `df -h` to check our disk space. This is a habit you want to build—always know how much space you’ve got left before spinning up containers or pulling new images, especially on cloud VPSes where storage is often tight.

Next, we’ve got `docker ps`, which lists all your currently running Docker containers. If it’s quiet here, don’t panic—that just means nothing’s actively running.

But if you want to see every container you’ve ever started, including the stopped ones, use `docker ps -a`. This is super useful for tracking down old containers you forgot about or for quick cleanup.

Finally, `docker images` shows you all the images you’ve got pulled on this box. Each one takes up space—so if you’re running low on disk, you’ll want to keep this list lean and remove images you don’t need.

Long story short: these are the basic commands for any dev or sysadmin working with Docker. Master these, and you’ll never be caught off guard by disk errors or orphaned containers again.

Let's go to the next step!
