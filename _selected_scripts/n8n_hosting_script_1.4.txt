Aaaall righty then! 

Let's connect to our droplet via ssh from our local system.

You do have set up your local system with ssh of course.

And I assure you, there are plenty of youtube videos you can find that will show you how to do that.

So, basically, once ssh is setup, all you have to do is type up this command,

ssh root@yourdroplet.com

you could also use the IP address of the droplet. But for this course, I will assume that you already know how to setup your domain on your digital ocean droplet.

Once again, there is plenty of videos on youtube that will show you how to set that up also!

All That said, let's move forward, shall we?
