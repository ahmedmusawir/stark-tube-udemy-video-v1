Here’s the first truth bomb: n8n doesn’t have a free tier anymore. That ‘Starter’ plan? It’ll run you about $20 a month, billed annually—and that’s before you add in the extra cost of ChatGPT, Perplexity, third-party APIs, and whatever hosting or VPS you need for your projects.

For devs, that stuff adds up fast—especially if you’re just trying to learn or prototype.

And that’s exactly why this course is about to get pretty geeky. We’re going beyond drag-and-drop, into the land of DevOps, self-hosting, and real control. Because these days, just being a coder isn’t enough.

With AI cranking out vibe coding zombies left and right, there’s a gold rush coming—and honestly, those zombies might be good for us in the long run. Why? Because they’ll be generating a lot of crappy apps, and guess who they’ll call to clean up the mess? Real developers who actually understand how software works.

So buckle up—this isn’t your typical low-code tutorial. We’re about to go full Tony Stark mode. Let’s go.
