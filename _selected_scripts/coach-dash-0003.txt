Now, let's look at the Dealer Section dropdown at the top.

We're bring this data, from a custom post type in our Woocommerce backend via the REST API.

The 4th box in the 2nd row that shows, "Total QR Code Clicks", is showing the total number of page view clicks for those Dealers by selected date range.

And that's what the first chart on the left reflects also, by date range. All these data comes from Google Analytics, which has been the biggest pain in the ass in this project!

When we choose a specific dealer from the dropdown, the Analytic data changes accordingly and reflects in the 4th data box and in the first Chart. 

We use localStorage caching heavily, for better filtering performance.
