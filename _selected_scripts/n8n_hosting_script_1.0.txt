Hello, Guys and Dolls!! The Moose is back!

Welcome to the world of n8n—where flexible AI workflow automation isn’t just for the big guys anymore.

n8n lets you build smart automations with the precision of code or the speed of drag-and-drop. Whether you’re hosting on-prem or in the cloud, you get the freedom to connect AI agents and apps faster than you can say ‘multi-step workflow.’

If you’re tired of hitting the walls with cookie-cutter automation platforms, this is where you start building *real* superpowers.

Alright, that’s enough marketing—let’s get to the part they never put on the homepage: the real cost, and why hosting n8n yourself can save your project (and your wallet).

Let's look at that next!
