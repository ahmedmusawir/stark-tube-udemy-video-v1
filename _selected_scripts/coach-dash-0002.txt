Ok let's look at this app's functionalities, shall we?

First, we look at the Filters and Controls section at the top. 

There is a date range selection block. By default it shows the current week. Thus, in the second row, we bring in, from the left,

The total revenue extracted from order data, by the date range.

Number or orders and the average order value. All comes from our Woocommerce backend via the REST api!

Accroding to that, in the second chart, we show a revenue bar chart by date.

Also, at the bottom of the app, which is shown on the right, we have the order details showing Order ids, dates, coupon codes etc. with pagination.

Next we explain the rest of the app!
