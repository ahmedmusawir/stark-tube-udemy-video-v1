Alright, before we get our hands dirty with n8n itself, let’s make sure Docker Compose is ready to roll. Just run `docker compose version`—if you see a version number like this, you’re good to go.

If not, don’t sweat it. On Ubuntu, just run:
apt update
apt install docker-compose-plugin

And since you’re already root, you can skip the sudo.

With Docker Compose in place, you’ve got the final piece of our automation toolkit for this setup.

In the next video, we’re diving straight into the real action: pulling the official n8n image from Docker Hub, configuring our environment, and firing up everything with Docker Compose. That’s where the fun—and the power—really begins.

See you in Part 2. Let’s deploy & configure something epic.
