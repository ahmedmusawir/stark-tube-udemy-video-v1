Okay! the last but not least ... 

when clicked on that "API Settings" button at the top, the whole API settings section drops!

this is where we put in:

the woocommerce site url, our main data source.

the consumer key and the secret key for REST api access.

and at the bottom, we input & save the Google Analytics ID and the service account json file content, which we collected from our Google Cloud console.

we use these credentials, pull data from our Woocom backend and Google Analytics. We also, have 2 buttons at the bottom of each block to test the connnections.

Now that you know the app details, let's look at the app architecture next!
