Time to play detective with your disk space. When things start getting tight, this command helps you spot the real space hogs at the top level of your root partition.

The magic here is:  
`du -h -d 1 / 2>/dev/null | sort -hr | head -20`

What does it do?  
- `du -h -d 1 /` shows you the sizes of each main directory under root, in human-readable units.  
- The output is sorted by size, biggest folders first, so you instantly see where your gigabytes are hiding.  
- The `2>/dev/null` bit just hides error messages to keep things clean, and `head -20` shows only the top 20 entries.

Looking at this list, you can see `/var`, `/usr`, and `/snap` are the biggest—those are always prime suspects when you’re running out of space.

Master this command, and you’ll never wonder where your disk vanished again.

Alright, next step coming up—let’s keep going!
